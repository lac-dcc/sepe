# Reproducing Sepe Results

This directory contains scripts to reproduce the results depicted in section 4 of the Sepe paper.
The recommended way of reproducing the experiments is through [Docker](docker).

This setup has been successfully reproduced in the following Linux distribution:

**TODO: Linux setup.**

## Prerequisites

To run the experiments, the following dependencies must be installed:

| Dependency | Version   |
|------------|-----------|
| clang      | >= 14.0.0 |
| CMake      | >= 3.20   |
| Rust       | >= 1.7    |
| Python     | >= 3.10   |
| Git        | >= 2.0    |

Additionally, to analyze the results the following python libraries must be available:

| Dependency | Version   |
|------------|-----------|
| matplotlib | == 3.9.2  |
| numpy      | == 2.1.2  |
| pandas     | == 2.2.2  |
| scipy      | == 1.14.1 |

It may be possible to reproduce the results with different library versions. However,
in case any incompatibilities arise, it is recommended to use the exact versions
listed above.

**TODO: commands to install dependencies**.

## Reproducing the experiments

Each experiment can be reproduced by executing the script in the directory of the same name.
There is no experiment for RQ4 because it is simply RQs 1 and 2 executed in a machine with an
aarch64 CPU.
